# Finding Highest Element in a Peak Array

This repository contains a Python function to find the highest element in an array that initially increases and then decreases (reaches a peak). The function is implemented to have a time complexity of O(log(n)) and space complexity of O(1).

## Problem Statement

Given an array where elements are initially in increasing order and then in decreasing order after reaching a peak element, the task is to find the highest element in the array.

### Example

**Input:**
Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

makefile
Copy code
**Output:**
Highest element: 6
