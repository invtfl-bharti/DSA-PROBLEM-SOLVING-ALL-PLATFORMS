Given an array arr[] of distinct integers of size n and a value sum, the task is to find the count of triplets (i, j, k), having (i<j<k) with the sum of (arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k]) smaller than the given value sum.


Examples :


Input: n = 4, sum = 2, arr[] = {-2, 0, 1, 3}
Output:  2
Explanation: Below are triplets with sum less than 2 (-2, 0, 1) and (-2, 0, 3). 
Input: n = 5, sum = 12, arr[] = {5, 1, 3, 4, 7}
Output: 4
Explanation: Below are triplets with sum less than 12 (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 5), (1, 3, 7) and (1, 4, 5).
Expected Time Complexity: O(N2).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:
3 ≤ N ≤ 103
-103 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 103
