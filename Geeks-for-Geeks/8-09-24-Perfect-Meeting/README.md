You are given a 2D array arrI]ll of size nx2, where each element represents the start and end
times of a meeting. Your task is to determine if there exists a time during which all the meetings
are occurring simultaneously.
Note: - Starting time should always be smaller than equals to the end time of a particular
meeting. The time of a particular meeting is inclusive of starting and ending time.
Example 1:
Input:
n = 3
arr010 = [ [1 , 3], [2 , 5], [3 , 11] ]
Output:
1
Explanation:
At 3rd hour all the meeting will be occuring simultaneously.
Example 2:
Input:
n = 2
Output:
arr] = [ [1, 9], [3 , 9], [11 , 12] ]
Explanation:
There doesn't exist any hour time where all of the meetings will occur
simultaneously.
