Given an ascending sorted rotated array arr. The array is right-rotated k times. Find the value of k.

Examples:

Input: arr = [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 1
Explanation: The given array is 5 1 2 3 4. The original sorted array is 1 2 3 4 5. We can see that the array was rotated 1 times to the right.
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: 0
Explanation: The given array is not rotated.
Expected Time Complexity: O(log(n))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= n <=105
1 <= arri <= 107
