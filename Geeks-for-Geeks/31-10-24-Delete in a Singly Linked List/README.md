Given a singly linked list and an integer, x. Delete the xth node (1-based indexing) from the singly linked list.

Examples:

Input: Linked list: 1 -> 3 -> 4, x = 3
Output: 1 -> 3

Explanation: After deleting the node at the 3rd position (1-base indexing), the linked list is as 1 -> 3. 
Input: Linked list: 1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 9, x = 2 
Output: 1 -> 2 -> 9
Explanation: After deleting the node at 2nd position (1-based indexing), the linked list is as 1 -> 2 -> 9.
Constraints:
2 <= size of linked list <= 106
1 <= x <= size of linked list
