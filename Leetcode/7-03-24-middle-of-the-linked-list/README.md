# Problem Statement

Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

## Example 1:

**Input:**  
head = [1,2,3,4,5]  

**Output:**  
[3,4,5]  

**Explanation:**  
The middle node of the list is node 3.

## Example 2:

**Input:**  
head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]  

**Output:**  
[4,5,6]  

**Explanation:**  
Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
- 1 <= Node.val <= 100

## Your Task
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `middleNode()` which takes the head of a singly linked list as input and returns the middle node of the linked list.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

## Repository Structure
- **README.md:** Provides problem statement, input-output examples, and task description.
- **solution.cpp:** Contains the C++ implementation of the `middleNode()` function.
