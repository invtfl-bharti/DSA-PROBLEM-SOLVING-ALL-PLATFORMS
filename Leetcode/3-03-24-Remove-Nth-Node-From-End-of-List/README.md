# Remove Nth Node From End of List

This repository contains a C++ solution for the problem of removing the nth node from the end of a linked list.

## Problem Statement

Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

### Example:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]

Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []

Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is sz.
- 1 <= sz <= 30
- 0 <= Node.val <= 100
- 1 <= n <= sz

## Solution:

The solution involves using two pointers, fast and slow, to find the nth node from the end of the list. Once found, the nth node is removed by adjusting pointers.

## Implementation:

The solution is implemented in C++. You can find the source code in the `solution.cpp` file.

## Usage:

You can use the `removeNthFromEnd()` function by including the `solution.cpp` file in your project and calling the function with the head of the linked list and the value of `n` as input.
